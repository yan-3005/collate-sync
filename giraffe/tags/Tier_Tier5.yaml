  description: "Tags related to tiering of the data. Tiers capture the business importance\
    \ of data. When a data asset is tagged with `Tier` tag, all the upstream data\
    \ assets used for producing it will also be labeled with the same tag. This will\
    \ help upstream data asset owners to understand the critical purposes their data\
    \ is being used."
